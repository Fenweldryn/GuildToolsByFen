# Guild Tools By Fen
This is going to be a toolkit to help manage guilds.

Currently the only funcionality is to show how long ago a guild member joined the guild in a tooltip when you hover the guild member name.

Exporting this data and showing guild contribution is comming soon.

Inspired by and based on Advanced Member Tooltip Addon.

### Requirements
* LibHistoire
* LibSlashCommander
