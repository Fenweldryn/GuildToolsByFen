# Guild Tools By Fen
This is going to be a toolkit to help manage guilds.

Currently the only funcionality is to show how long ago a guild member joined the guild in a tooltip when you hover the guild member name.

Exporting this data and showing guild contribution is comming soon.

Inspired by and based on Advanced Member Tooltip Addon.  

**this addon relies heavily on LibHistoire since it reads all guild history from LibHistoire's logs**

## How to get old data
If you have just installed this addon and need older data than that available in LibHistoire you can request more data from the guild history interface, hotkey E (bottom of the screen) and click refresh on LibHistoire interface. If you need a lot of old data you will have to click show more a lot. Remember to click refresh or else LibHistoire will not refresh the logs.
